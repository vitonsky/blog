# About Me

I'm Robert Vitonsky, a **software engineer** and [open source](https://github.com/vitonsky) enthusiast.

I have solid expertise in the development of complex web services on both sides: frontend and backend. On both sides, I pay close attention to [code quality](</blog/tag/code quality/>), and sometimes I take notes about it on this blog.

I'm **founder** at [FluidMinds](https://fluidminds.org), a B2B software engineering team, and sometimes I write posts with my reflections and insights about [#management](/blog/tag/management/). These are my vision and advice on how to build processes in teams to make them efficient.

I program mostly with TypeScript and NodeJS, but also in Python and Java. So most of the code examples are in these languages.

I would highlight my deep experience with the development and maintenance of UI kits, machine learning systems, and some hardcore things like cryptography, media streams processing, and security systems with fraud protection and user behavior patterns recognition. All these things are deeply interesting to me and may appear in my blog from time to time.

# Blog Format

My blog is about software engineering. Here I post about development practices, code quality, project and team management, and open source.

I don't like blog posts with long text, and I believe those who read my blog have no time for "long reads".

This is why I prefer to read and write concise short posts with no fluff.
