# About Me

I'm Robert Vitonsky, a **software engineer** and [open source](https://github.com/vitonsky) enthusiast.

I have solid expertise in development of complex web services on both sides a frontend and backend. On both sides I take a huge attention to [code quality](</blog/tag/code quality/>), and sometimes I take notes about it on this blog.

I'm **founder** at [FluidMinds](https://fluidminds.org), a B2B software engineering team, and sometimes I write posts with my reflection and insights about [#management](/blog/tag/management/). There are my vision and advices how to build processes in teams to make it efficient.

I program mostly with TypeScript and NodeJS, but also in Python and Java. So most of code examples is on this languages.

I would highlight my deep experience with development and maintenance of UI kits, machine learning systems, and some hardcore things like cryptography, media streams processing and security systems with fraud protection and user behavior patterns recognition. All that things is deeply interesting for me and may appears in my blog time to time.

# Blog Format

My blog is about software engineering. Here I post about development practices, code quality, management of projects and teams, and about open source.

I don't like blog posts with long text, and I believe those who read my blog have no time for "long reads".

This is why I prefer to read and write concise short posts with no fluff.
