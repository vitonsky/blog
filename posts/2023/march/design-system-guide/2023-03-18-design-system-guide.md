If your frontend project don't have a design system then it is usual problem when even a small changes like changes a color for action buttons takes off a lot of time, generate a big pull requests and make interface look inconsistent. To solve the problems, you should start use a design system. Let's talk what is it and how to use.

The design system is a principles and rules to form an user interface on the project.

It is possible that actually you have a design system in your mind, but you didn't share the principles with your team. Try to discuss the rules with all teams who works on UI, to find out a features of project and to prevent conflicts and rules collisions.

## The structure

A design system is a documentation that contains a key principles and guides with how to apply a principles to a specific technologies.

Most important sections to explain

- Color system
  - How to work with a colors
  - Project palette
  - Color transformations
  - Color details for text, icons, shadows, the most important common things
- Design tokens
  - Key principles explanation
  - How to use, how to add a new tokens
  - Naming and grouping strategy
- Components guides
  - Anatomy
  - Variants
  - Usage guidelines
- Patterns
  - Guides how to implement a most common features
  - Accessibility instructions
  - Layout principles
- Assets guides
  - Iconography
  - Typography
  - Formating, compression, etc.
- Resources and tools
  - Where to find an assets (icons, fonts, images, videos)
  - What tools used on project

Don't worry, you can start from writing a few most important sections for your project, to share principles with your team or with another team and enreach your design system with a new docs later, when you feel the powerful.

## How to use

All people who work on UI design must consider these principles to reach uniform style on the project level.

Tell about your design system to your design people before they will start to create a new design.

Require developers to obey a design system principles. When you review a pull request and you see violations with a design system - reject the PR with links to a related sections.
