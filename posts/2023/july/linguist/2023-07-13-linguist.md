Browser is most used program by me and by most users of internet, so it is important for browser to be high efficient for daily routine. Altough browsers have embedded translation features and exists a lot of browser extensions for translation, all of them have bad quality and absolutely not acceptable for intensive use. This is why i've create Linguist - ultimate browser extension for translation.

I start development of [Linguist](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist) in *June of 2020*, when i've tried to find solution for translation in browser, as you see, i did not. I tried really hard, but all of them had very bad quality, a [mate translate](https://gikken.co/mate-translate/) quality stood out significantly and it has good UI, however it is not have open source code, collects analytics and most of basic features are paid (even history and dictionary).

A common problem for all browser extensions - they are just wrappers over google translator widget. Google translator are good translator, but it is far of ideal, other translators works better for some cases and languages directions.


# Meet the Linguist

[Linguist](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist) is all-in one translation solution, you can use full page translation, translate selected text, paste text for translate, use text to speech feature, add important translations to a dictionary to find it later if you learn languages like me.

## Use your favorite translation service

Linguist have few embedded translators, include google translator, and you can add your favorite translator to linguist yourself with [custom translators](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist/blob/bcc8c471fdede42b6bbc541144eb89a93587f605/docs/CustomTranslator.md) button. I really like this powerful feature, with Linguist you are not locked on Google Translator anymore!

Look, you can just insert any JavaScript code that implement translator interface:

## Keep your privacy

Start of version 5.0, Linguist includes embedded offline translator, based on [Bergamot project](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator) - mozilla's machine translation project, compiled to WebAssembly.

With offline translator, you will not sent your private texts over internet at all. Translation runs on your device locally, you still needs internet to download AI models for your languages direction once, then you can even off your internet connection and continue to translate texts.

Unlike other browser extensions, Linguist is not just wrapper over Google Translator Widget, so all translation features are available offline with offline translator, thus you can use all Linguist features and stay private.

## Learn the languages

With dictionary you can bookmark translations and find it later, when you need those expressive words you've found. I like this feature well, my dictionary is about 800+ translations. Of course, there you can search translations with fuzzy search.

This features makes Linguist ideal tool for traveling, because it saves your internet traffic, can translate even offline if you lose the internet, and helps you to find the words with offline dictionary.

Linguist works on smartphones, but not works on iOS, because iOS does not have a browser that supports WebExtensions API, only Safari. I'm sad to see how my friends who uses iPhone can't even translate the restaurant menu, they looks surprised when i translate sites on my Android with Linguist.
