I've developed a few browser extensions, and every week I receive numerous emails with "revenue offer". Some experienced developers know that offers like these will inject malware into the browsers of your users, but scammers who make these offers will not tell you about it. They offer "integrations" that don't look so suspicious. Imagine how many developers have accepted these offers. Then look at the number of extensions in your browser and think about how much risk there is that you have an extension with malware.

Browser extensions may request a lot of permissions, which can be necessary to implement some features and to improve the user experience. However, having wide permissions can increase the attack surface for hackers. This is why browser extensions are a great target for hackers.

Browser extensions can access any content on a page, such as emails, private messages in social media, and bank account information. Extensions may also capture pressed keys and send passwords to hackers. The collected data may be sold or used by hackers to steal money, identities, or for blackmail.

In recent years, browser extensions have started inserting advertisements on web pages. Here's how it works: a browser extension developer signs up on an ads platform and creates an account for some application. Then they inject ads on any web pages users visit and earn money from clicks. Sometimes even the ads platform doesn't know how the developer is generating clicks.

These are not the only ways hackers can use malware in your browser. They can also click on links, open sites in the background for DDoS purposes, and more. The key point is that your browser will be shared with a hacker.

Let's see how extensions can be hijacked in case the developer is not a hacker.

# Monetization offers of scammers

Extension developer may even not be a hacker, but extension may be hacked by third party.

I frequently received emails like this:

> ![I trust you're doing well. I want to introduce an exclusive revenue-generating opportunity for your Google Translate extension, through our specially curated Premium Bing Hosted Product](monetization.png)

The problem we have is some developers agrees the offers like this. As result, hackers on screenshot above will inject a malware into the clear extensions with good reputation.

Developer may even does not see the problem, he's just will include third party code that not looks as malware and really do things scammers claimed, for example above it may add a Bing suggestions in search.

Malware may intentionally does not executes for some people like developer and app stores reviewers, but executes for users. This is why it is not secure embed external resources like javascript code, but developers do it under different pretexts.

If you are developer and you think about offer like this, remember that you not just betray users who trust you, but also your extension will be removed everywhere in near few months when users will sent enough reports.

# Offers to buy project

Except "monetization offers" my spam folder also contains offers like this

> ![I hope you're doing well. I came across your Chrome extension and wanted to ask if you've ever considered selling it](buy-offer.png)

The idea the same - scammers offers to buy a project (usually for funny money like $10.000), but actually they want to buy users to hack and rob them.

# How to protect yourself

As you see, even if a extension developer are not a hacker, you still in danger, because extension still may be hacked.

Browser app stores tries to "moderate extensions", but usually it means the extensions analyzes with a automated tools that tries to detect malware patterns and in case a hacker hide it proper way, a robot will approve new release.

To decrease risks you should keep as minimal extensions as possible and get known more about extension and about its author before install it.

Author must be a real people with github and social media, not a random person.

Author must be high qualified programmer and hacker, otherwise author may be easy deceived by scammers.

Browser extension must be open source. In case if you can't find extension sources, you may be sure it's malware.

The less dependencies extension code have the better for security.

Never install random extensions with no background check.


# What extension developers should do to protect their users

Never allow to embed content from external servers. It mostly about scripts, but external pages in iframe or static resources like media files also may be used by scammers to collect IP addresses of your users or show unacceptable content.

With great power comes great responsibility. You have to be hacker to detect and reject integration offers with scammers. Only one way i see to do it - write code every day and try new things to enrich your experience.

You should also make your code able to develop by other programmers, they may detect your suspicious activity. Add docs with explaining key design principles of your software and invite other developers to review and audit your code.
