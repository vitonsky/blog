Let's say you need to choose some technology for your project, or you already have problem with some technologies, so you want to replace those to another ones. If you no have a decision log then you have a high risk to make bad decisions that are biased, based on authority and takes too long.

Did you have faced with a case when you have problems with some technologies and nobody can explain why we use this solution but not another. Or, maybe decision takes a lot of time on your project, because a team no have a consensus?

The both problems are result of lack a decision logs. You may eliminate such problems with a simple rules below.

## Converse a solutions in writing

Don't make calls with your team to make decision if you no have consensus. You will just waste your time and time of your team, and then team will be forced to make sub optimal decision under pressure.

Technical conversations must be in writing. This format are better at least because it asynchronous, all people have enough time to think about problem, to research and to present their arguments effectively.

If someone in your team can't argue their position in text discussion, it is not a reason to make a team call, because it will not help nobody. Such people usually just no have arguments and resort to social manipulations, to sell their solution. It is a problem for a project, when decisions not makes based on facts and its analysis.

## Write your decisions

When you making decision on your project, log it into some place available for everyone in team, like a github issues or discussions, wiki pages, notion, etc.

The mandatory sections is
- potential solutions list with pros and cons for every solution
- chosen solution and explanation about the reasons why this one, but not another
- potential problems with choses solution if any

You may add more sections if you want, like involved people or links on related decisions that make current solution are consistent or something else that will be useful in future, to understand why this solution been accepted and what context we had.

## Analyze your decisions and consequences

Before make a final decision, review the summary you formed. This step are trivial, but you may found the problems in your research process just by read the summary. If your summary have only 1-2 solution for general problem, or the arguments looks not as facts, but as opinions, it may mean that you need more research before make final decision.

If you have decision log and current solution does not work for you, you may just try an alternative solution in a list. Keep in mind that information may be deprecated, in that case you should start new research.
