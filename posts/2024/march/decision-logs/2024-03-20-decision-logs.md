Let's say you need to choose some technology for your project, or you already have problem with some technologies, so you want to replace those to another ones. If you no have a decision log then you have a high risk to make bad decisions that are biased, based on authority and takes too long.

Did you have faced with a case when you have problems with some technologies and nobody can explain why we use this solution but not another. Or, maybe decision takes a lot of time on your project, because a team no have a consensus?

The both problems are result of lack a decision logs. You may eliminate such problems with a simple rules below.

## Converse a solutions in writing

Don't make calls with your team to make decision if you no have consensus. You will just waste your time and time of your team, and then team will be forced to make sub optimal decision under pressure.

Technical discussions should be conducted in writing. This format is preferable because it is asynchronous, allowing everyone ample time to consider the problem, conduct research, and present their arguments effectively.

If someone in your team cannot articulate their position in a text-based discussion, this is not a reason to convene a team call. Such individuals may lack substantive arguments and may resort to social manipulation to push their solution. This poses a problem for the project, as decisions should be based on facts and thorough analysis.

## Write your decisions

When making decisions for your project, log them in a place accessible to everyone on the team, such as GitHub issues or discussions, wiki pages, Notion, etc.

Include the following mandatory sections:

- Potential solutions list with pros and cons for each solution.
- Chosen solution and an explanation of why this option was selected over others.
- Any potential problems associated with the chosen solution, if applicable.

You may add more sections if you want, like involved people or links on related decisions that make current solution are consistent or something else that will be useful in future, to understand why this solution been accepted and what context we had.

## Analyze your decisions and consequences

Before make a final decision, review the summary you formed. This step are trivial, but you may found the problems in your research process just by read the summary. If your summary have only 1-2 solution for general problem, or the arguments looks not as facts, but as opinions, it may mean that you need more research before make final decision.

If you have a decision log and find that the current solution is not effective, you can simply try an alternative solution from the list. However, keep in mind that information may become deprecated over time. In such cases, it's important to initiate new research to ensure you have the most up-to-date and relevant information.
