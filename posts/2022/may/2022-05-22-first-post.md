Welcome to my blog. I've create it to expressing my opinion, primarily about programming.

My plan are writing ideas to my blog and refer other people here later, to avoid repeating my point many times.

Today, social media are hide posts of people with undesirable points of view and even remove all their content. Users is not have control on own posts. This is why i create my blog instead of account on popular site.
