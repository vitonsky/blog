Big tech companies invest a lot efforts to sell us a point that every **good programmer** must have their own open source project. Many programmers have open source side projects, but quite few of them can explain why they waste their time on it. As result, they work for free, to make big tech rich. Actually, open-source can't make money for programmers, but may be useful as a promotion tool for them.

Many programmers who start work on new personal open source project have a material motivation.

Programmers believe that enough to make a cool project, then people will discover it on their own, will like it and start use it, will pay for it, spread the world about a product.

Maybe it's because they have seen a too much cool stories of influencers on twitter and believe it is true.


## Opensource gives no money

Reality check #1 - open source gives no money.

While there are news that looks like "[Open source software boosted the EU economy by ‘between €65 to €95 bn’](https://www.euractiv.com/section/tech/news/open-source-software-boosted-the-eu-economy-by-between-e65-to-e95-bn-report/)" and "[IBM buying Red Hat for $34 billion](https://www.wired.com/story/ibm-buys-red-hat/)" it proofs nothing but open source is useful for companies to make money on it. Nothing about maintainer earnings.

I can't found any statistics how many other developers earn on their open source projects, except promote posts by influencers like [Tailwind CSS: From Side-Project Byproduct to Multi-Million Dollar Business](https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduct-to-multi-mullion-dollar-business/), but there are [some articles](https://www.businessinsider.com/open-source-developers-burnout-low-pay-internet-2022-3) with claims like

> A Tidelift survey of nearly 400 open-source maintainers said 46% are paid nothing for their work. Of those who do get paid, only about half receive over $1,000 a year.

I have [couple open source projects](https://github.com/vitonsky) too. Some of them is quite successfull, like [Linguist](https://linguister.io/) that have over **180k active users**.

My experience is quite similar to quoted stats. I got **about $3k** in donations for **more than 4 years**. That is about $700 per year.

At my projects I never asked users money "for beer" or "for coffe" like it does a lot of projects. I have [post about threats](/blog/2024/06/20/politics-in-software/) of software who acts like that.

But even if it would up donations to 10k per year it is still nothing compared to base salary of programmer at any EU country.

Sometimes I got irrelevant requests to buy a project for ridiculous prices like $30k that is still lower than base salary of any programmer in EU.

I have [post about such requests](/blog/2023/09/01/malware-in-browser-extensions/#monetization-offers-of-scammers). The summary is people looking for projects to buy its users base, to inject malware/spyware/ads and earn more money. Btw, next time you will see request for donations at any project, think about reasoning in head of product owner. What stops them to sell you for $30k if they needed in money?

Ask your friends who have open source projects "how much you make on it?". Probably you will hear the same story.

So don't be confused, you will not earn money on open source pet projects like that. You will just waste your time inefficiently. You can just find a programmer job in some company and have at least $100k base salary.

There are other options to make money on open source that does really work.

One of most popular is a commercial open source based on [open core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model)

>  The open-core model primarily involves offering a "core" or feature-limited version of a software product as free and open-source software, while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as proprietary software.

Another direction, very popular in USA, is a startups that built to sell it as soon as possible. The point is to find a pain, then implement a solution and sell it to anybody before big tech will clone it and will promote it with its marketing capacities. Such projects have short life time and in terms of time it makes enough money to cover spending on programmers, promotion and make extra money.


## Open source is a promotion tool

Many people believe that the secret of success is just to make a cool project, and then another people will discover it and will use it.

Reality check #2 - nobody will use your project with no promotion. Any project with no promotion is doomed to fail.

Nobody will even get know that your project is exist. If you have product - promote it. If you don't, it will be lost, nobody find it, and you just waste your time.

But how to promote your project? Internet is one of the worst places for product promotion, because of high level of spam, it costs high and gives a low conversion rates.

The goal of any social media platform is to lock their users into echo chamber, to retain users engagement, so they hide any posts that has not been paid.

**Good news**, open source is a good platform for promotion.

Open source product that fix a real pains will be in demand, if you will boost it initially among those who have pain you solve.

Open source project have a lot of benefits, including **capacities to build trust** to your product and team.

At [PrimeBits](https://primebits.org), we avoid a software that cannot be self hosted or modified for our needs.

Personally I'm trying to avoid proprietary software, since it have no even foundation of trust. Any trust is already destroyed on first step when developer spent money to lead me in app store where no present any links to source code. Because such software may do anything on my device and I have no chance to figure out how exactly it does work. I can't even report bug or track how development goes.


Of course, open source also means that your code may be stolen by some big corporation to [sell it as a cloud service](https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/), or to modify for their needs. But that's problems that is good to have.

As developer, you should use your open source products to build trust, and promote related products and services. This is how many open source companies does.

In my case, when a [Linguist](https://linguister.io/) start grown, I've got 4 new clients for [PrimeBits](https://primebits.org) per year. They reached us through GitHub, and we built products for them, paid our stuff and make enough to maintain Linguist for free.

This is one of most efficient models in terms of time and money. It makes viable a maintenance of projects with open source code, unlike donations model that can't cover even cost of nice bike that save you against burnout.


## Contribute back!

**Promotion is crucial** for any open source project for both sides as for developer, as **for users**.

Because if you, as user, found some nice open source project and you do not participate to make it popular, you have chance to find a project with maintenance some time ago.

As I told, donations in open source projects is too small to motivate developer to do anything. Your $10 or $100 is not enough to drive development.

So if you found some nice open source project, keep your money and spread the world about it.

This is more valuable, and equal to donation a few thousands dollars.
